## Scoop

You can install the application through [Scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) if you have my bucket installed.

I recommend installing through scoop to have the app accessible on your "path"

`scoop bucket add Faustvii 'https://github.com/Faustvii/scoop-bucket.git'`

`scoop install StartupManager`

#### Columns explanation

- `Name` is either the
  - Registry key name
  - Shortcut filename without extension
  - Task scheduler name
- `Admin`
  - Shows if you need to have administrator priviliges to modify it
- `Enabled`
  - Shows if the startup task is enabled or disabled
- `Path`
  - Shows the path and potential arguments to the application

### Enable

Examples of usage `StartupManager.exe enable Steam` or `StartupManager.exe e Steam`

```text
Steam is already enabled
```

Or

```text
Steam has been enabled
```

### Disable

Examples of usage `StartupManager.exe disable Steam` or `StartupManager.exe d Steam`

```text
Steam has been disabled
```

Or

```text
Steam is already disabled
```

### Add

The add command has a "wizard" that will guide you through the required steps, if you do not supply all the needed arguments when using the command.

#### Examples of usage

`StartupManager add MyWelcomeApp "C:\new folder\test.bat" "Hello to you sir!" false false` would output

```text
Added MyWelcomeApp to startup
```

`StartupManager add [Name] [Path] [Arguments] [RunAsAdministrator] [ForAllUsers]`

 `StartupManager add MyWelcomeApp` or  `StartupManager a MyWelcomeApp` would output this (Notice it doesn't ask for the name because it was supplied already)

 ```text
PS C:\> StartupManager add MyWelcomeApp
Let's guide you through settings up a new startup program

What's the path to the program?: C:\new folder\test.bat
What's the arguments for the program?: "Hello to you sir!"
Do you want to run this program as an Administrator? y/n: n
Do you want to run this program for all users? y/n: n

Name: MyWelcomeApp
Path: C:\new folder\test.bat
Arguments: "Hello to you sir!"
Administrator: False
All Users: False

Does this look correct? y/n: y
Added MyWelcomeApp to startup
 ```

### Remove

This command will remove a program from starting with windows by deleting the registry entry, task or shortcut.

Examples of usage

`StartupManager remove MyWelcomeApp` would output

```text
Are you sure you want to delete 'MyWelcomeApp' y/n: y
MyWelcomeApp has been removed
```

It's possible to skip the confirmation by adding the option `--confirm` or `-c`

`StartupManager remove MyWelcomeApp --confirm` or `StartupManager r MyWelcomeApp -c` would output

```text
MyWelcomeApp has been removed
```
